# Address-Standardisation

Implementing the T5 sequence-to-sequence model on an imperfect dataset of Indonesian Addresses with the help of reverse geocoding.

## Pre-requisites

- Google API Key: To use the Google Reverse Geocoding API for labelling addresses, you must obtain an API key from the Google Cloud Console.
- Python 3
- A suitable environment to run .ipynb files (e.g. Jupyter, Google Colab)

## Description

Given a dataset of features such that a subset of the features contains some address and their corresponding coordinates, we determine whether the labels generated by reverse geocoding those coordinates would create a suitable dataset for supervised learning with LLMs.
